# Craigslist Job Scraper

My first Ruby script.  Written when I was perusing craigslist daily for jobs, and wanted several categories and cities on one page.

Currently it takes posts from Madison and Milwaukee, WI, from the categories of software, systems, tech support, and web design.

##Usage
simply run the script with `ruby cl.rb` and it'll generate an html file in the same directory called `craigs_jobs.html`.


##Dependencies
rubygems, mechanize, and time
